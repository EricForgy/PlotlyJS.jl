# Parsing

## `role`s

We need to look at the `role` tag on each attribute to determine how to set it up.

This tag only takes on one of 4 values: `data`, `info`, `style`, `object`.  For the first three, we can usually map them directly into native types *or* custom types with a single field named `value`. Some examples are


### `data`

```json
"x": {
    "valType": "data_array",
    "description": "Sets the x coordinates.",
    "role": "data"
},
```

In Julia we just have `x::Vector` as the field

### `style`

```json
"opacity": {
    "valType": "number",
    "role": "style",
    "min": 0,
    "max": 1,
    "dflt": 1,
    "description": "Sets the opacity of the trace."
},
```

In order to enforce the min/max constraints we use a custom type. The field we add is `opacity::Opacity`, where the type is defined as

```julia
type Opacity <: AbstractAttribute{StyleRole}
    value::Float16

    function Opacity(x::Float16=1)
        if !(x >= 0 && x <= 1)
            msg = "This object must be >= 0 and <= 1 the values"
            error(msg)
        end
        new(x)
    end
end
Base.convert(::Type{Opacity}, x::Real) = Opacity(Float16(x))
```

### `info`

```json
"visible": {
    "valType": "enumerated",
    "values": [
        true,
        false,
        "legendonly"
    ],
    "role": "info",
    "dflt": true,
    "description": "Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If *legendonly*, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as a legend item (provided that the legend itself is visible)."
},
```

This time we to enforce that the value belongs to the enumerated set. To do this we add a field `visible::Visible`, where

```julia
type Visible <: AbstractAttribute{InfoRole}
    value

    function Visible(x=true)
        validvalues = [true, false, "LegendOnly"]
        if !(x âˆˆ validvalues)
            throw_enumerate_error(validvalues)
        end
        new(x)
    end
end
Base.convert(::Type{Visible}, x::Union{Bool,ASCIIString}) = Visible(x)
```

### `object`

Things are a bit trickier when we have `role == object`. In this case what we have been doing is breaking down the object into many smaller types based on the above rules. Here's an example

```json
"textfont": {
    "family": {
        "valType": "string",
        "role": "style",
        "noBlank": true,
        "strict": true,
        "arrayOk": true
    },
    "size": {
        "valType": "number",
        "role": "style",
        "min": 1,
        "arrayOk": true
    },
    "color": {
        "valType": "color",
        "role": "style",
        "arrayOk": true
    },
    "description": "Sets the text font.",
    "role": "object",
},
```

Here we decided to do the following:

```julia
type FontSize <: AbstractAttribute{StyleRole}
    value::Float16

    function FontSize(x::Float16)
        if x < 1.0
            error("Text size must be greater than 1")
        end

        new(x)
    end
end
FontSize(x::Number=12) = FontSize(Float16(x))
Base.convert(::Type{FontSize}, x::Real) = FontSize(Float16(x))

type TextFont <: AbstractAttribute{ObjectRole}
    family::ASCIIString
    size::FontSize
    color::Colors.Colorant
end
```

We needed a custom type for the `fontsize` to enforce the minimum constraint.

## `valType`s

Each attribute in the schema has a `valType`. This, as you might expect, specifies the type of the attribute. Each of these `valType`s is defined in the `defs.valObjects` section of the schema. Below is a list of all the possible `valType`s in the schema and a short description of how we think about them in Julia:

- `string`: a string. In Julia this would have a type `AbstractString`
- `number`: a number. Represented in Julia as `Number`
- `flaglist`: A string representing a combination of flags (order independent). Different available `flags` with `+` (e.g. `x+y`). Represented as an `AbstractString`
- `any`: anything. Represented in Julia as `Any`
- `geoid`: A geoid string (e.g. `geo`, or `geo1`). `AbstractString` in Julia
- `angle`: A number between -180 and 180. A `Real` in Julia
- `colorscale`: This one is long, so I quote the schema:

>A Plotly colorscale either picked by a name: (any of Greys, YIGnBu, Greens, YIOrRd, Bluered, RdBu, Reds, Blues, Picnic, Rainbow, Portland, Jet, Hot, Blackbody, Earth, Electric, Viridis ) customized as an {array} of 2-element {arrays} where the first element is the normalized color level value (starting at *0* and ending at *1*), and the second item is a valid color string.

Represented as `T<:Real, Union{String, Vector{Tuple{T, String}}}`

- `data_array`: a 1d array. Julia's `Vector`
- `enumerated`: a object of any type that takes on one of a finite set of values. Just `Any` in Julia as we don't have information on the types of the enumeration (see `scatter.visible` for an example where this could be `Bool` or `ASCIIString`)
- `integer`: an integer. Julia `Int`
- `info_array`: just some array of plot info. `Vector` in Julia
- `sceneid`: a scene id string (e.g. `scene`, or `scene1`). `AbstractString` in Julia
- `axisid`: an axis id string (e.g. 'x', 'x2', 'x3', ...). `AbstractString` in Julia
- `color`: a string describing a color. In Julia we use `Colors.Colorant` and convert to a HEX string when sending to JSON
- `boolean`: simply `Bool`

## `opts`

Each attribute has associated with it a number of options, which we will call `opts`. For specific `valType`s some of these are required, some are optional, and some are not applicable (see `defs.valObjects`).

Below is a list of all possible `opts` that might be present in the specification of the attribute and a short description of how this impacts our codegen:

- `dflt`: what is the default argument. Here we set the default arg on the constructor
- `min`: minimim allowable value. Applies only to numeric objects. The precense of this field triggers the creation of a one field type, where the field is typed to be a `::Number` and an inner constructor is created to enforce the lower bound on the input. If present without `max`, `max` is implicitly set to `Inf`.
- `max`: same as `min`, but for upper bound. If present without `min`, `min` is implicitly set to `-Inf`.
- `arrayOk`: specifies that the field can take one value, or many in an array. This will trigger a `Union{T, Vector{T}}` type constraint on the field and will require elementwise constraint checking.
- `noBlank`: specifies that a particular field is required. By default, all fields that should be of type `T`, are actually given type `Union{T,Void}` and a default value of `nothing`. However, if `noBlank` is present the type remains `T` and no default value is provided.
- `strict`: always used in conjuction with a `string` `valType`. TODO: Still don't know what it does. Use in source code [here](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/734f75fdb9ccd6ca362c0b01b632f01eb2c0066e/src/lib/coerce.js#L101)
- `values`: always used in conjuction with an `enumerated` `valType`. It describes the set of feasible values.
- `extras`: always used in conjuction with an `flaglist` `valType`. This specifies additional possibilities for the value, but these cannot be arbitrarily combined with the items in the `flags` field. Triggers additional constraint checks in the inner constructor
- `coerceNumber`: the field must be a number. All this does is trigger a `::Number` type constraint on the field

## Generation

We now understand how the parsing happens. Next we turn to how the types are generated.

We perform type generation using "factory" functions. These are functions that take a description of the type to be generated (more on this later) and return an `Expr` containing the type definition and other auxiliary functions.

The behavior of a factory is driven by the combination of the `valType` and



### Comments

#### Convert

Notice that for each subtype `ST` of `AbstractValueAttribute`, where the `value` field has type `T` we defined a method:

```julia
convert(::Type{ST}, x::T) = ST(x)
```

The reason we need this method is that we would like users to be able to change the value directly with "dot-notaion" without having to worry about whether the value sits in a custom or native Julia type.

For example, suppose we have a `Scatter` trace named `s`. If we wanted to change the opacity to `0.5` and didn't have this method, we would need to call

```julia
s.opacity.value = 0.5
```

This is bad for at least two reasons:

1. Sometimes we won't have custom types, in which case we will not have a `.value` field to set. We don't want users to have to think about whether or not they need to append a `.value` before changing an attribute.
2. We completely bypass the constraint checks imposed in the inner constructors -- often the only reason we make custom types to begin with.

Instead what happens when we do have this method and call `s.opacity = 0.5` is roughly equivalent to `s.opacity = Opacity(0.5)`. This solves both the problems above: the user doesn't have to think about `.value` and we have to go through our inner constructor when changing the value of the field.

<!-- TODO: Need to handle `arrayOk` as Union{T,Vector{T}} -->

#### Extra fields

It looks like plotly.js will simply ignore any defined fields that don't belong in a particular trace or object. This means that we can define one `ColorBar` type that has fields as the Union of all colorbar attributes across traces and the right things will get ignored at the right time.
